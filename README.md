# Javascript Calculator
This web app was developed as one of <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a> advanced front-end projects. The goal was to replicate a simple calculator! I achieved this using JavaScript for the logic/arithmetic, jQuery for any interaction with the page itself, and CSS for the styling. I enjoyed the challenge of diving deeper into JavaScript programming, and especially the challenge of incorporating the intricacies of the user experience that we often take for granted when using a calculator (eg. negative numbers).
